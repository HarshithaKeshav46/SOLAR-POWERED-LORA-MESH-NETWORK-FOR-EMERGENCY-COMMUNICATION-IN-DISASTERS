# SOLAR-POWERED-LORA-MESH-NETWORK-FOR-EMERGENCY-COMMUNICATION-IN-DISASTERS
A low-power, self-sustaining LoRa mesh communication system powered by a solar panel and Li-ion battery, designed to provide long-range messaging & location sharing during disaster scenarios where cellular or internet connectivity is unavailable.
This repository includes firmware, hardware documentation, offline map integration, and demo instructions.

📌 Features:

▫️ LoRa Mesh Communication (long range, 2–5 km depending on terrain)

▫️️ Solar-Powered Node with Li-ion battery & TP4056 charge controller

▫️ Web-Based User Interface (Chat, GPS Map, Node Status)

▫️ Wi-Fi Access Point from ESP32/TTGO (clients connect even without internet)

▫️ Offline Maps Integration (served locally from microSD)

▫️ Real-time messaging using WebSockets

▫️ SD-Card Static File Server for web UI + map tiles

▫️ Compact & disaster-friendly hardware
